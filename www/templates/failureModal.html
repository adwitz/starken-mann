        Great! That might have been a bit too easy--you did five or more reps.  Would you like to increase your base 1RM to {{score.weight}} for your next workout?

        It looks like that may be been a challenge.  A lighter weight may help you progress more effectively.  Would you like to decrease your 1RM to {{score.weight}} for your next workout?
